TO DO
=====

Play the CPANTS game
--------------------

But remember that this is not an end in itself. It is just
a mean (kwalitee checking) towards an end (quality).
For example, the module did not get the points for
the LICENSE POD paragraph. Yet, there is a LICENSE POD paragraph. Just the
automated CPANTS check did not recognize its contents.
But any human reader will admit the paragraph is correct.
So this is a kwalitee issue I will not fix.
And I will not complain to the authors of the programs
that power the CPANTS site. I have better things to
do and they have better things to do.

But there are other issues that need to be fixed.
I will fix them (when the CPANTS website is up; at
the moment it is down).

Play the Devel::Cover game
--------------------------

I know that you can have 100% code coverage and still
have bugs in your module. Yet, having a poor coverage
is a sure recipe to have lurking bugs in your code.
So I will strive to have a better code coverage, 
while not forgetting to expand the data coverage.

Yet, the original author has provided six trigonometrical
function using degrees: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan.
But only three of them are used in the module. So
the other three are not covered by the tests. I will leave
them just like that, I will neither delete them, nor create
a bogus test file just to ensure there are green-colored
in the Devel::Cover reports.

Other topics
------------

I have mentionned data coverage. In fact, the "precise" algorithm
is not truly checked. It is colored in green with Devel::Cover,
but I have not compared its output with another source.

Since this module is OO, there could be convenience accessors,
retrieving the longitude and the latitude of a given 
DT::E::Sunrise object.

There is always room for improvement in the documentation.
