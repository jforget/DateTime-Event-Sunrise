        - add the "is_polar_night", "is_polar_day" and "is_day_and_night" boolean methods

0.0501  Wed Mar 31 2004
        - added fix for DateTime-Set after 0.1402
        - I had to remove one test (the span set test) I need to check
          to see what is going on I think I need to rewrite this test

0.05    Fri Jan 9 2004
       - Added sunrise_sunset_span method. This will return rise/set time
         for one day (as a span object). Request # 4785 on rt.cpan.org
	 Added sunrise_datetime, sunset_datetime method.

0.0402  Tues, Nov 25 2003
       - Changed the convert_hour to convert to seconds (as a duration)
         Then add the duration to the day. This will provide seconds for
	 the DateTime Object. 
       - Added many tests (Cities around the world). I have verified the
         entries in the data section of the tests within +- 2 min. using
	 the information from the Naval Observatory (aa.usno.navy.mil).

0.0401  Thurs Oct 8 2003
       - changed the _sunrise sub to include the timezone information
       - (I don't like the way I did this needs more research)

0.04   Fri May 30 7:40 2003
       - Fixed a bug in _sunrise 
         The problem was I was setting the hours/min for the rise/set times
         I needed to create a duration and add the duration to the DateTime
         Object.

0.03   Tues April 29 14:00 2003
       - initial release to CPAN
       
0.02   Mon April 21 13:20:00 2003
        - doc tweaks. Flavio S. Glock
        - renamed sun_rise_set to sunrise_sunset
        - gets methods from DateTime::Set
